HI, This Project goal is to learn to create a razor website to display military level
of all alliances from politics and war nation simulation game.
Feel free to contact me in discord Limbu#7616.
So far, I've added all nation and related api from PW into my database
Sorted data for alliance in another table.
Displayed Nation and alliance military level in their respective page.
Each alliances nation and their respective military can be viewed as well.
Added Register and login including google login.
Added email verification.
however, There are no restricted pages that can be viewed right now
I will add a page to draw chart only accessible after login.
I am now adding custom authorization
and restricting some pages for viewers if not logged in.
Thank you
